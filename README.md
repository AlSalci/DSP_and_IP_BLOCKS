The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with the IP blocks provided by Xilinx. The code implements a device that will recieve data from the two memory blocks,
then will send the signed values into a DSP to multiply the data together. Once the values have been multiplied, half of the result will be stored in one of the two memory blocks.
